# **Health Pilot – AI Medical Report Assistant**

**Health Pilot** is an Android app designed to help users **easily understand their medical reports**. It uses OCR to extract text from lab reports and AI to provide simple, patient-friendly explanations of medical values, highlighting whether results are normal, high, or low.

---

## **Features**

* **OCR (Image to Text):** Upload or capture lab reports to extract text.
* **AI Analysis:** Sends extracted text to an AI API (e.g., Groq API) for interpretation.
* **Simplified Explanations:** Provides plain-language descriptions of lab results.
* **Result Indicators:** Shows whether values are normal, high, or low.
* **Secure API Handling:** Uses `BuildConfig` and `local.properties` for API keys.
* **Optional Chat:** Users can ask follow-up questions for clarification.

---

## **Tech Stack**

* **Language:** Kotlin
* **Frameworks:** Android SDK
* **Networking:** Retrofit, Gson, OkHttp Logging
* **Storage:** Local device storage for report history
* **AI API:** hugging face API (or Groq API for testing)

---

## **Project Structure**

* `MainActivity.kt` – Handles UI, OCR, and API communication
* `RetrofitClient.kt` – Retrofit client setup
* `ReportAnalyzer.kt` – Extracts lab values using regex
* `HuggingFaceResponseItem.kt` – JSON response model

---

## **Setup Instructions (For New Viewers / Replication)**

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Open in Android Studio**

   * Use Android Studio Arctic Fox or higher.
   * Sync Gradle to install dependencies.

3. **Add API Keys**

   * Store your hugging face API key in `local.properties`:

     ```
     HF_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
     ```
   * Access in code via `BuildConfig.HF_API_KEY`.

4. **Dependencies** (already in `build.gradle`):

   * Retrofit, Gson, OkHttp Logging
   * ML Kit / OCR library
   * AndroidX and Material Design components

5. **Run the App**

   * Connect an Android device or use an emulator.
   * Build and run `MainActivity.kt`.
   * Upload a medical report to see the analysis.

6. **Optional Improvements / Contributions**

   * Enhance regex for lab value extraction.
   * Add RecyclerView chat UI for better interactions.
   * Implement cloud storage for report history.
   * Fine-tune AI prompts for more accurate results.

---

## **Usage**

1. Open the app on your device.
2. Upload or click a photo of your medical report.
3. Wait for OCR to extract text.
4. View AI-generated explanations of your lab results.
5. Ask follow-up questions in chat (if implemented).

---

## **Future Roadmap**

* Advanced AI interpretation with medical context
* Multi-language support for reports
* Cloud sync and secure storage
* Personalized health insights and notifications
